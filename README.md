# data-wrangling-project


# Steps we took for this project:


1.- Look for an **interesting topic** and formulate some hypotheses.

2.- Investigate some **data sources** available for your chosen topic.

 (Create a Kanban board for project management purposes.)

3.- Set up a **GitHub repository** and practice working collaboratively on the repository.


Data Collection:

4.- We did **Web Scraping** from each web of some electric companies.

We inspected the website’s structure, and wrote a script to scrape the required data. 

That got us 9 datasets including the data from 4 companies.


Data Wrangling:

We examined the data and understood every field before proceeding with data cleaning and manipulation.

5.- We developed a plan for **cleaning and transforming the data**.

6.- First of all we made a dataset for each company.

7.- Then we cleaned the data.

We structured the data to make it suitable for analysis. 



Day 4

    Finalize all cleaning, transformation, and analysis tasks.
    Finish doing basic EDA and use the insights gained from it to validate or disprove the initial hypotheses.
    Finish refining your code according to best practices.
    Prepare a visually appealing presentation with minimal text to effectively communicate the insights and conclusions to stakeholders. Make sure to build a compelling narrative that highlights the significance of your analysis.

Day 5 

    Deliver a presentation in class.
    Project & Module retrospective.
