# ⚡🔋 Electric and Solar Tariff Recommender 🔋⚡

![Descripción de la imagen](streamlit_app/image.jpg)

## 📋 Objective
The goal of this project is to provide personalized recommendations for solar panel installations in homes, helping users to save on their electricity bills and contribute to a more sustainable world. 🌍✨

## 🛠️ Functionality
This application allows users to input their electricity consumption data and receive recommendations on the number of solar panels they should install. It also compares different solar tariffs to find the most economical option. 💡🔋

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Streamlit** 📊
- **Pandas** 🐼
- **BeautifulSoup** 🌐
- **Selenium** 🕵️‍♂️
- **Matplotlib** 📈

## 🛠️ Development Process
1. **Topic Selection**: We started by looking for an interesting topic and formulating some hypotheses related to solar energy and electricity consumption.
2. **Data Source Investigation**: We investigated various data sources available for our chosen topic, focusing on electricity consumption and solar tariffs.
3. **Project Management**: We created a Kanban board using Trello for project management purposes, allowing us to track our progress and collaborate effectively.
4. **GitHub Repository Setup**: We set up a GitHub repository and practiced working collaboratively on the repository.
5. **Data Collection**:
    - We performed web scraping from the websites of several electric companies using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
    - We inspected the website’s structure and wrote scripts to scrape the required data, resulting in 9 datasets from 4 companies.
6. **Data Wrangling**:
    - We examined the data and understood every field before proceeding with data cleaning and manipulation.
    - We developed a plan for cleaning and transforming the data.
    - We created a dataset for each company and cleaned the data to make it suitable for analysis.
7. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - We performed basic EDA to gain insights and validate or disprove our initial hypotheses.
    - We used visualizations to better understand the data and identify patterns.
8. **Model Development**:
    - We developed a model to recommend the number of solar panels based on user input.
    - We implemented a comparison tool to find the most economical solar tariff.
9. **User Interface**:
    - We built an interactive user interface using Streamlit, allowing users to input their data and receive recommendations.
10. **Finalization**:
    - We finalized all cleaning, transformation, and analysis tasks.
    - We refined our code according to best practices.
    - We prepared a visually appealing presentation to effectively communicate our insights and conclusions.

## 📊 Results
The application provides users with:
- The recommended number of solar panels to install.
- A comparison of different solar tariffs.
- The estimated savings from installing solar panels.

## 📈 Summary Report
The summary report includes:
- A comparison of solar tariffs.
- Visualizations to support the analysis and conclusions.

## 🗂️ Trello Board
We used Trello for project management, allowing us to track our progress and collaborate effectively. Our Trello board included tasks for data collection, data wrangling, model development, and user interface design.
